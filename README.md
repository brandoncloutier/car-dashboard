# Car Dashboard

A custom-built **automotive infotainment and real-time telemetry dashboard** that integrates **live OBD-II vehicle data, Mapbox-based navigation, music playback controls, and smart widgets** into a modular, customizable interface.  

This project blends **IoT, web technologies, and embedded systems** to create a polished, interactive driving experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture

The system follows a **hybrid client-server model**:

- **Frontend**
  - Built with **React + Redux + TailwindCSS**
  - Grid-based component library with resizable/movable widgets
  - State management for syncing OBD data, user settings, and media playback

- **Backend**
  - Node.js/Express server
  - WebSocket service for streaming OBD-II data
  - API endpoints for map routing and third-party integrations
  - Authentication and user session handling

- **OBD-II Integration**
  - Raspberry Pi connected to vehicle OBD-II port
  - Python WebSocket client reads ECU data using `python-OBD`
  - Streams real-time data to the server and front-end

- **External APIs**
  - **Mapbox** for maps, directions, and route planning
  - **Spotify / Heos API** for music control
  - **Google Maps API** for address validation
